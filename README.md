# Flask Application Deployed on AWS ECS

A lightweight **Flask web application** designed to demonstrate **containerization, orchestration, and deployment on AWS ECS** as part of a hands-on **DevOps learning initiative**.

The application is intentionally minimal, allowing the primary focus to remain on **Docker, AWS ECS, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure concepts**, rather than application complexity.
