# Flask App on AWS ECS 🚀

A minimal **Flask web application** built to demonstrate **containerization and deployment on AWS ECS** as part of a **DevOps learning journey**.

This project is intentionally simple so the focus stays on **Docker, ECS, CI/CD, and infrastructure**, not on bloated application logic.

## 📌 Application Overview

The app exposes two HTTP endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Returns a welcome message |
| `/health` | Health check endpoint used by ECS / Load Balancer |
